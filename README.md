The goal of this project is to win a 10 person NFL fantasy football league by employing automation and machine learning methods.

Current goals: 
Figure out what statistics will be useful for leveraging substitutions and picking up free agents.
  Especially want to consider how teams respond to certain positions
  How do quarterbacks fair against the Cardinals?
  How do runningbacks fair against the Chargers?
Scrape these statistics from "The Football Database" website.
Leverage feature engineering to find which features contribute most to weekly points
